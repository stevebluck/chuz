# Exploring Remix + Effect + DDD

## What the Bluck is this?

This repo is exploring what a Remix and Effect combo with a flavour of Domain Drvien Design could look like. I plan to evolve this into a **real** production ready starter kit for my side projects.

It's by no means ready but helps me scratch that itch. I'm constantly refactoring so expect big changes frequently.

After sharing snippets of code on X I have received many requests from people wishing to see how I am doing certain things so here it is.

## The goal

- Follow DDD practices inspired by the ol'mighty Scott Wlaschin
- Use Effect to build a robust and maintaible business application
- Make invalid states unrepresentable using the power of TypeScript/DDD.
- Model errors and have decent error management across the network broundary
- Role my own auth
- Unit/integration/e2e tests
- Ensure the API's are beautiful
- Build for scale

## Values

- Make invalid states unrepresentable
- Code to an interface
- Keep the core business logic pure
- Parse don't validate
- Type safety

## Capabilities I plan to add

I plan to add the things that I personally think every production ready application should include plus some features just for the funsies.

- Users
- Subscriptions
- Payments
- Feedback
- Feature flags
- Experiments
- Analytics
- Translations
- Tracing
- Metrics
- Logging
- Probably more...

@datnerr
I have stolen code from the talented Datner's Remix project regarding the loader/action interop with Effect. You should check out his Remix project here.

@mattphillips
Matt has been an amazing help when it comes to code architecture, domain modelling and testing. Give him a follow.

Scott Wlaschin
I have learnt so much from Scott when it comes to DDD and functional programming. You should read his book and watch his YT videos.

Effect
The Effect discord has been nothing but amazing when it comes to asking questions or needing some help - go check it out.
